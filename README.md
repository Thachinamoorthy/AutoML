Writing
End-to-End AutoML Deployment Agent
📌 Project Overview

In the evolving landscape of Machine Learning (ML), automating the end-to-end pipeline—from data preprocessing to deployment—remains a significant challenge.
This project, End-to-End AutoML Deployment Agent, streamlines the ML workflow by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, training, and deployment.

The system is designed for both beginners and experts to explore ML workflows with minimal manual effort while maintaining flexibility and explainability.

🚀 Features
Interactive Data Insights – Understand your dataset before training.
Automated Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encoding, scaling, and feature selection.
AutoML Training – Powered by FLAML for lightweight and efficient model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
Explainability – Model interpretability using SHAP.
Multi-Model Benchmarking – Compare multiple models and pick the best fit.
Deployment – Deploy trained models seamlessly using Streamlit.
Retrain Loop (Optional) – Automated retraining when new data is available.
Downloadable Modular Pipeline Code – Export code snippets for further customization.
Microservices Architecture – Ensures scalability and modularity.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage
Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

Upload your dataset (CSV).
Explore data insights generated by the LLM agent.
Start AutoML training with FLAML.
Review benchmark results and SHAP explainability.
Deploy your chosen model and interact via the web app.
📊 Example Workflow
Upload Dataset → data.csv
Data Insights → Summaries, correlations, and suggestions by the LLM agent
Train Models → FLAML auto-selects and tunes models
Explain Predictions → SHAP plots
Deploy → One-click Streamlit deployment
